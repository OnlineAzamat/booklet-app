# Kitap Pechat üìñ (Booklet Printing Utility)

**PyBooklet Printer** is a cross-platform (Linux & Windows) desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for preparing and printing PDF documents in booklet (saddle-stitch) format. It solves the common problem of manually sorting pages for double-sided printing.

This project was initially developed to bring the convenience of specialized booklet printing features, often found in Windows applications, to the Linux environment.

## ‚ú® Features

The application provides two core functions to handle your printing needs:

### 1. PDF Document Preparation (Automated)

* **Input:** Selects an original PDF file.
* **Range Selection:** Define a specific range of pages (e.g., page 10 to 50).
* **Automatic Padding:** Automatically checks if the total page count is divisible by 4. If not, the necessary number of blank pages are added (zero-padded) to ensure correct booklet order.
* **Output:** Generates **two separate PDF files**:
    * `filename_ALDI_T√ÅREP.pdf` (Pages for the front side of the sheets)
    * `filename_ARQA_T√ÅREP.pdf` (Pages for the back side of the sheets)
* *You simply print the first file, flip the stack, and print the second file.*

### 2. Manual Page Order Calculation (For Word/Excel/PPT)

* **Input:** Enter the total number of pages you wish to print.
* **Output:** Generates the precise, comma-separated sequence of page numbers required for booklet printing.
* **Separate Lists:** Provides **separate lists** for the "Front Side" and "Back Side" pages. (e.g., `8,1,6,3...` and `2,7,4,5...`).
* **Wrapper (Chunking):** Includes an option to split the long list of page numbers into smaller chunks (e.g., 10 sheets/40 pages at a time) to avoid exceeding printer buffer limits.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

## üí° Contribution & Feedback

This project is my first attempt at building a cross-platform GUI application using Python/Tkinter. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community, especially regarding code structure, efficiency (for large PDFs), and UI/UX improvements.
